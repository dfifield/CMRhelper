\title{Simulate capture histories from a fitted CJS model}
\usage{
simul.boot(extract)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{(required) a list as returned from \link[CMRhelper]{extract.model}.}
}
\value{
A simulated capture history formatted as a data.frame ready for analysis with
 usual RMARK functions. Generally sent to \link[RMark]{process.data}() as the
 next step.
}
\description{
Simulates a new capture history with the same structure and rates.
}
\details{
This function is designed for relatively straight forward models, although it
 can handle age effects, as estimates are extracted directly from their PIMs.
 Any individual covariates are ignored, however covariates in the design
 matrix would be included, as they are reflected in the PIMs.
